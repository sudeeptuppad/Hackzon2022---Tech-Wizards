       <h3> <center><p>Anger is a very strong emotion, and it is important to know what to say to someone who is angry with you to avoid aggravation. Someone who is angry with you may say things they don’t mean and the situation may easily spiral out of control.
The best thing to do in a situation where someone is angry with you is to de-escalate before tackling the issue. It may be hard to figure out what to say when you are angry yourself or you feel like you are being attacked.
We have outlined some important things to pay attention to or consider that will help you determine what to say, and have included detailed examples that are sure to work.
           1. Listen
 
Listening is the most important thing you can do. It is more important than what to say to someone who is angry with you. It shows that you are aware and willing to address his/her concerns.
           2. Put your emotions to the side
 
Angry people are hurt, so they may say or do things they don’t mean in the situation simply because they are angry and don’t know how to process their emotions. Do not take anything too personally, and address anything hurtful after the situation is diffused.
          3. Try to find the root of the anger
 
The only way to truly solve the problem is to address the root of the anger. Actively listen and ask relevant questions. Afterward, propose a logical or reasonable solution where possible.
