        <h3> <center><p>It’s never not awkward telling someone I have anxiety disorders. And I’ve had to tell a lot of people: friends, family, supervisors, dates. (Nothing puts a damper on date night quite like saying, “Hey, so I’m really into you but I kind of feel like I’m going to die right now.”) 

Opening up to others can be validating and freeing, but it’s always stressful at first because I don’t know how they’ll respond. Being stereotyped or treated insensitively when you’re struggling can be nerve-wracking, especially if you already get down on yourself for having anxiety. (Guilty.) 

What I’ve learned in my many years of coming clean is that most people mean well. They don’t want to say the wrong thing, but it can be hard for them to know the right thing to say if they don’t know much about anxiety.
            “Anxiety is normal and healthy. It keeps us safe and motivates us,” Lostutter says. “It only becomes a problem when someone becomes overly anxious and it interferes with daily life.” 

Anxiety disorders are one of the most common types of mental illness — and they’re on the rise, no thanks to the pandemic. Around 19% of the U.S. adult population is affected in any given year. Chances are you know someone who has clinical levels of anxiety.
       Here are some text 
            say: “I’m always here for you.” 
You don’t have to understand what your friend is going through to be there for them, and you don’t have to compare your experiences to theirs to show them that you understand what they feel.  

If you don’t know what it’s like to have severe anxiety, be honest about that. But also let them know that you know it’s real for them and you want to be there to support them however you can. 

Showing you care will help if your friend is self-conscious about their anxiety or has a hard time opening up about it. Listen without judgment to what they have to say and what their experiences are like. Being there for someone even when you can’t relate is a powerful way of showing support. 

Don’t say: “Have you tried meditation/yoga/cutting caffeine/exercising more?” 
Meditation and yoga and deep breathing and all of the other anti-anxiety trends that have taken pop culture by storm might be helpful for some people, maybe even your ultra-anxious friend. But they also might not.  

Extreme anxiety can feel consuming, which means that small things like taking a few deep breaths might not be enough to counter panic in the moment. Anxiety can also make someone feel so restless that sitting quietly and letting their thoughts float away is pretty much impossible.
