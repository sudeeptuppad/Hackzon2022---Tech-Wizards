        <h3> <center><p>Happiness is so interesting, because we all have different ideas about what it is and how to get it. It’s also no surprise that it’s the number one value for Buffer’s culture, if you see our slidedeck about it. So naturally we are obsessed with it.
            The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!
            Do you think you are a happy person? Truly happy people do not wait for happiness to find them; instead, they bring positivism and happiness to themselves. They understand that their words are the best tools they have to make others happy, which makes them happy too. Check out these 3 things happy people say every day:
            1. “I am really happy to see you.”
A huge part of making yourself happy is making sure that the people around you are happy. This statement is one of the simplest ways to let someone know that being in their presence makes you feel positive, and it shows that you value and respect them.
            2. “Seeing you always makes me happy.”
This ups the ante of the previous statement–it is presenting the same positive message while implying that the person you are talking to always holds the power to make you feel positive. For the person you are talking to, they will feel grateful, appreciative and happy, and you will feel happy for putting a smile on someone’s face.

3. “I took your suggestion.”
If someone has given you advice, it is normally because they care about you and want to help to come up with solutions to your problems. No doubt this will have made you feel good–we all love to be cared for! It doesn’t matter if they gave you advice on how to save money or if they recommended a café; return the favour by telling them that you listened to them, and what they said impacted and benefited you.
