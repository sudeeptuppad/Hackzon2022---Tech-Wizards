You can’t change the fact that we’re living in a pandemic or the effects of COVID-19, but you can control how much the fear that comes with it impacts you. Sometimes the hardest thing about feeling afraid is that you don’t know what to do to change it. If that sounds familiar, here are some things you can do to help yourself:  

Talk to a trusted adult. If you’re a bit lost on how to handle this whole situation, check in with an adult about how you’re feeling. This could be a parent, teacher, coach, or someone else you trust. Whether you don’t quite know what COVID-19 is and how to stay safe, or you’re worried about starting a new school year virtually or in-person, an adult can help calm your fears and give you tips to stay healthy and comfortable. 

Limit your screen time. While it’s important to understand what’s happening in the world, there’s such thing as too much information. Constant news coverage might make you feel more scared of COVID-19, and social media can be full of false information and worst-case scenarios. Unfollow or mute social media accounts if they’re constantly upsetting you. If you see a story or statistic that worries you, bring it up to someone who can help you talk it out.

Remind yourself of ways to stay safe. Even though things seem scary right now, there are a lot of ways to keep yourself safe—and you’re probably already doing most of them! Washing your hands regularly, wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large groups are all ways to reduce your risk of infection. Remind yourself of these things and challenge yourself to think of more reasons to not worry.  

Take some deep breaths. Focusing on your breathing is a great way to relax and reduce some of the anxiety you may be feeling. When you feel big emotions, you might notice you start to breathe faster. If you work to slow your breathing, it signals to your brain that it’s time to calm down. Try 4-7-8 breathing: breathe in for four seconds, hold for seven seconds, and breathe out for eight seconds.</p></h3></center>
